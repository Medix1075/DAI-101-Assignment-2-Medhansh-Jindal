# **Objective**:

 The goal is to develop a predictive model to estimate tip amounts in restaurants using customer billing and demographic data. This will help restaurants tailor services and optimize operations by better understanding tipping behavior.

# **Methodology**: 

Regression Techniques Applied:

 Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest (Ensemble Method), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression,

# Data Analysis:
Scatter Plots, Pair Plot, Correlation Matrix (Heatmap), Rainbow Test, Residuals Plot, Line Plot

# Model Performance:
Metrics:

RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination), 
Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 

# Insights for Management:

## Impact of Group Size
Larger groups tend to tip differently compared to smaller parties. This insight can help adjust service strategies:

Small Groups (1-2 people): May prefer quicker, more personalized service, and often tip based on direct interaction.

Large Groups (3+ people): Tips may be more dependent on overall group satisfaction, so ensuring consistent service across the table is crucial.

## Bill Presentation

Highlighting the total bill in a customer-friendly way could subtly encourage higher tips.
